# GMaps
This is my project pitch

### UX

The aim of this project is to provide a webpage for users wanting to plan their vacations by giving them the possibility to choose places where they would like to go, and giving them comprehensive results.  

Therefore, through this project we tried to answer the following user stories :

* As a tourist, i need to find places near me, in order for me to have a good meal.
* As a lost person , i need to find a place nearby in order for  me to have a place to spend the night.
* As a group of people, we need to find a good bar nearby, to have a good time.
